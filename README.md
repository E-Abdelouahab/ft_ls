# ft_ls
As simple as listing the files in a directory.

The project ft_ls opens the path to the Unix branch of the sphere system. For the first
time, I had to face the one libc functions that allowed me to do other things
than just read or write on a file descriptor (this is to simplify of course). I discovered
a sub-system of functions of operating systemâ€™s API, the associated data structures, as
well as the management of memory allocation and the associated data.
ft_ls was also a great opportunity to think about the structure of my code before I
even start writing my code. ft_ls bad reputation is due to students discovering too
late in the game that their (lack of) initial design is preventing them from finishing their
project without refactorizing a great part of their code. I admit that it can be frustrating...
To conclude, ft_ls is another opportunity to add to my libft new practical functions. 
Browsing a file and identifying directories is quite common in programming.
